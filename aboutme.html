        <h2>Hi, I'm Edward! Since early 2024, I've been diving into the world of building and selling computers, and it's quickly become more than just a hobby—it's a passion. There's something incredibly satisfying about taking components and turning them into a powerful machine, tailored to someone's needs. 

            My journey started with a simple interest in technology, and it has evolved into a full-blown love for creating custom PCs. Each build is a new challenge, a new puzzle to solve, and I thrive on the opportunity to bring ideas to life.
            
            When I'm not building computers, I enjoy staying updated on the latest tech trends and continuously learning new techniques to improve my craft. My goal is to not just create functional machines but to deliver something unique and tailored to each customer.
            
            Thanks for stopping by my page—I'm excited to see where this journey takes me next!

        </h2>

        <p>This is my first attempt at building a PC and making it look nice (Yes, I know it looks bad)</p>
